## About Data Structures

The study of data structures serves as the foundation for several fields of computer science such
as programming, compiler design, and database management. Almost every program or software
uses data structures as an effective and efficient means of data storage and organization. Often, the
success of a program or software depends upon the way the data is represented and the algorithm used
to process the data. While programming, different kinds of data are required to be stored and processed
in the computer. Data can be stored in a generalized format using variables. A data structure uses a
collection of related variables that can be accessed individually or as a whole, and represents a set of
data items with a specific relationship amongst them. Thus, choosing an effective data structure is the
key to success in the design of algorithms.
